## Intro + background on Paper pre-color picker

## Why is it needed?

* With the ability to Mix the work of other's the need to match color to seamlessly contribute became clear.

## How to use it

* You have to own the Color Mixer.
* Tap on the circle disc and an eye dropper will appear.
* Drag around the canvas to sample the color you'd like.

## Sharing colors

* Include swatch marks with your drawing in the margins for easier sampling. Especially helpful for other Mixers who may want to remix your idea.
* Share as numeric values. Tapping the color mixer will reveal values for each of the 3 sliders (hue, saturation, and luminosity).

## Color palettes

A selection of my default palettes. Feel free to add you own by remixing the original template on Mix by FiftyThree.
